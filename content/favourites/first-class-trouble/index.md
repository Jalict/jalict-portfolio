From August to November in 2018 I had the pleasure of doing an Internship at [Invisible Walls](https://www.invisiblewalls.co/), where I got to work on [First Class Trouble](http://www.firstclasstrouble.com/).

I worked as Gameplay Programmer in Unreal Engine and got to implement core systems, mechanics and user interfaces. All the features were also developed for online multiplayer by me.

Most of my work involved:

- Zone-based Oxygen System
- Multi-purpose Door System
- Collectable Passenger Logs
- Implementation of new User Interface

All my work was done i close collaboration with the team, I had a lot of freedom to come up with my own ideas and prototype them for the team. I was also taken into design meetings for evaluating mechanics and coming up with new ideas.

I really enjoyed my time at Invisible Walls and got a lot of experience with multiplayer, blueprint and working on bigger projects in Unreal Engine.
