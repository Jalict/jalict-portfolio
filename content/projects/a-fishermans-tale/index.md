For Global Game Jam 2019 I worked on a fishing-ish game. Your objective is to capture fish and to retrive them to your home island.

I worked mainly on some fishing triggers, effects and sound implementations.

The general idea was that we wanted to explore some of the new Shader Graphs and Visual Effect tools.

Game was made together with [Andy Touch](https://connect.unity.com/u/andy-touch), [Sven Santema](http://sven.whalefall.nl/), Rare≈ü Popa and [Nikolaj Licht](https://nikolajlicht.com/). The game can also be found on [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/fishermans-tale)
