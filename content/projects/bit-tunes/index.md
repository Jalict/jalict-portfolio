As part of a gift series I have started for my friends, I came up with a Bit Tunes generator for my second device.

The device is using an Arduino, two potentiometers for input and a piezo speaker for output.
The user can turn on the device, in which is starts playing random notes, you can then modulate them using the dials creating new sounds.
I wanted to emulate something old and recognisable for the sound, so it is like old bit tunes.
The device is portable using a standard 9V battery and is turned on by holding down the red button.

The device is part of my *"shitty devices"* series which is a series for me to get more experience with electronics and new or different input/output modalities and just making some neat gifts for my friends.
The series have some criterias for fun, which are:
- Needs some kind of input and output.
- Should be interesting, but not usuable to TOO cool - After all, they are shitty!
- Needs to be done inside a small transparent enclosure.
