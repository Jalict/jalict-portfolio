For the Game Prototyping course at ITU Games Technology we were given the task to design a Sport.

The requirements were
* Design a Sport (analog)
* Teams of no more than 3 people
* It has to use props (ball, sticks, ...)
* Round duration: 10 minutes (can have multiple rounds)

The primary concept of the sport revolves around the idea of each of the two teams having a waterbottle that the opposite team must tip over. The team whose waterbottle have been depleted of water have lost.
