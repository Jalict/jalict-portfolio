For the Game Prototyping course at ITU Games Technology we were given the task to create a game **one button game**.
The requirements were
* Input with 1 button
* Max playtime, 5 minutes
* Combos allowed (Account repetition)

Our group went with a infinite runner like game. You drive a bus where you have to do different actions (Using a single button) on the thing you are about to encounter.

The bus drives itself forward. As objects start getting closer to you, you have to to different things in order to proceed. This can be to lower a bridge so you can drive over to the other side of the water. Chop a log up laying on the road. 

Each encounter have a differnet type of input method, but only using spacebar.

The game is played using spacebar
