For the Game Prototyping course at ITU Games Technology we were given the task to create a game which invokes a certain emotion.

We had several emotions to choose from, our game focuses on *confusion* and *envy*

The requirements were
* 2 players
* No playtime constraint
* Using a console controller
* No music (but yes to SFX)

The game is a platformer where you objective is to hold an object the longest. The catch is both players have 5 players they control simultaneously and you have to find out which one of them you are. Vice versa, your enemy has to discover which one is the real enemy, in order for them to get the object back from you.

The game is based on Windows 98 aesthetics, the players play as Clippy and Evil Clippy and both have to obtain the Cursor in order to win. The windows act as Platforms, so you can jump on top of the Windows in order to get higher.

The game is played using XBOX 360 controller.
* Left Analog for Movement.
* A Button for Jumping
* B Button for Melee attack (To make other players drop the pointer)
