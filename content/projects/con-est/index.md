Rovers from Russia and China are on a mission to getting Science signals from Earth.

The Game is a Team-based Local Multiplayer, where the goal is to receive a pattern of 4 notes (Left and Right Motor) through Haptic Feedback in your controller in which you have to communicate to your partner who has to use Left and Right Shoulder to mimic the pattern. As you succeed to establish a connection and slowly earn points until you win, when you are linked you have to avoid crossing your link with an opponent or asteroids. 
Beware of incoming Asteroids!

The game was made together with [Kasper Lichtenberg](http://kasperhdl.dk/), [Jonas VHM](http://jovh.dk) and [Itai Yavin](http://iyavin.one/)
