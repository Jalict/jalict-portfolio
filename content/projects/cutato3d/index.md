Is a spiritual successor to my first Ludum Dare game, Cutato. The game revolves around peeling potatoes in a rather chaotic setting. 

Made for Game Jam 2 by AAU Game Lab - Theme: Fix Your Old Project

Game won the first price

The game was made together with [Alex Rymark Vorm](https://soundcloud.com/alex-vorm),
