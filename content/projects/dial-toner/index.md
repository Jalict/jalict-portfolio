For my fourth device in the *shitty device series* I have made a Dialer. Using the keypad the user "call" any number which will output the common DTMF tones. You can choose to record a specific set of numbers and then play them back, creating a sort of a sequencer also.

It uses an Arduino Nano, 3x4 keypad, 9V battery, two piezo speakers for tones, and a toggle switch to turn it on and off.

The device is part of my *"shitty devices"* series which is a series for me to get more experience with electronics and new or different input/output modalities and just making some neat gifts for my friends.
The series have some criterias for fun, which are:
- Needs some kind of input and output.
- Should be interesting, but not usuable to TOO cool - After all, they are shitty!
- Needs to be done inside a small transparent enclosure.
