For my fouth semester at my bachelor program I had the chance of working on a Virtual Reality with focus on researching navigation using sound in limit visual environments.

Most of my work was done in implementing and adapting Binaural sound systems. And working on recording real-time data of the test participants.

The project was made togehter with [Emil Holmen](http://emilholmen.com), Nicklas Bundgaard, Andreas Ryge, Hans Emil Hoppe Rauer, [Rasmus Bons](http://www.bons.one/), [Alex Rymark Vorm](https://soundcloud.com/alex-vorm)
