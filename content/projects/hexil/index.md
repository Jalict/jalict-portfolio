BIRTH. REPRODUCTION. DEATH. MUTATION

HEXIL is game about reproduction your hexagon. The game is heavily inspired by *Conyway's Game of Life*, but with added depth in form of solid and non-solid hexagons and mutations. Mutations will kill more and filled hexagons gives your a higher score.

The game is made without a direct clear goal and exist more as an exploratory puzzle, but a score can give a sense of progression.

The game was made for Level One: Jam at IT University on my own.
