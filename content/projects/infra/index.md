As part of the Aalborg University, Medialogy “Purposive Game Production” (5th Semester)  programme (PGP) a game has been produced to accommodate this. The game allowed three people to work together to solve tasks in virtual reality by cooperating with each other.

The game is multiplayer based and requires a three Oculus Rift for each player. The game was done in a team of 20 persons where I was a Senior Programmer for the project. Team:
