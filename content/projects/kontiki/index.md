My bachelor project at Aalborg University was an investigation of character behaviour and engangement. We looking into the how players were affected when NPC's have behaviour change in their own emergence. We implemented a whole visual communication system and created a smaller community using Utillity based AI. The NPC's had jobs and different needs and desires and in the test scenario the player could not just interrupt if the NPC were doing something specific at the time.

Most of my work on the project involved implementing online testing tools, utility ai, models, user experience and level design. 

The project was made together with Silvija Malciute, [Kasper Lichtenberg](http://kasperhdl.dk/) and [Itai Yavin](http://iyavin.one/)
