Aliens have come to earth- but got in a fight with themselves! Unfortunately their Zappers only work with forces, so they have to shoot objects at each other in order to fight. 

The game is a Local Multiplayer, Fighting platformer. You only have one weapon which bullets makes both objects and players bounce around - You defeat your enemies by hitting them with other objects and making them fly out of the map.

Made for Nordic Game Jam 2015, Theme: Obviously. 

The game was made together with [Emil Holmen](http://emilholmen.com), Alex Rymark Vorm, Nicklas Bundgaard
