POSTBUD is about bringing the mail to your friendly neighbourhood.

The world is “infinity” as in you can proceed to the end of the world and come out of the start.

I had the idea that you had specific mail to specific places in the world. And it was your job to find these places in time before they got angry.

Due to me getting into an accident to only worked on it for like 7 hours and then about 2-3 hours with only one hand.

**You play using:**
- WASD to move
- Mouse to look around
- Left Mouse button to charge
- and release it to throw mail.

The game was made for Ludum Dare 38
