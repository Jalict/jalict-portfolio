For my thesis on MSc. Games Technology I worked together with [Sven Santema](http://sven.whalefall.nl/) on implementing a spline-based interface for skin weight editing inside the Unity Engine.

The goal of the project was to implement and test a state-of-the-art method developed by Bang and Lee[1] to identify user experience and usability within the implementation inside Unity. A prototype was implemented which works for real-time editing where users can create skinning from the ground up.

Much of my work was initial prototyping, conversion of Bang and Lees binaries to libraries and marshalling with Unity, optimisation, gizmos and interface options. 

The project was supervised by [Mads Johansen Lassen](https://game.itu.dk/members/mads-johansen-lassen/) from IT University and made in collaboration with Unity Technologies with [Dave Hunt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anatomecha/) as external supervisor.
