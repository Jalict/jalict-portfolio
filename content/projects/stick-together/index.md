For Ludum Dare 37, Theme: One Room. I made a game in Unity where you have to pick up sticks and put them in a pile.
The idea was that the players only run around in a single instance, one room.
I nearly got the primary mechanic done on first day. And my intention was to work on Multiplayer on second day.
