For my 3rd semester at my bachelor I worked on a Tool made in Unity which could interpret hand-drawn paper topography. Using a USB HD Webcam we were able to crop, cut and do image processing in real-time which were translated into a terrain in Unity. After the terrain stage you were able to draw symbols in order to create Towns and Forests in the world.

The motivation was to have easier methods for creating game worlds for artists with much faster prototyping methods which could be further development using ordinary unity tools.

The project was made togehter with [Emil Holmen](http://emilholmen.com), Nicklas Bundgaard, Andreas Ryge, [Rasmus Bons](http://www.bons.one/)
