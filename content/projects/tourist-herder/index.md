You play as a Tourist guide who are to follow the tourists around town. Show them the big sights the town and make sure they don't get caught up at some place or that they see something displeasing - They are a very tough crowd.
But make sure that you get to the bus with as many passengers as possible.

The game was made for Summer Game Jam 2017 (Local Game Jam which I host) with the theme 'One City Block'

The game is controlled using Arrow keys for Movement and Z, X for Call and Stop command.

The game was made together with [Bjørn Højlund](http://bjornhojlund.strikingly.com/), [Alex Rymark Vorm](https://soundcloud.com/alex-vorm), [Kasper Lichtenberg](http://kasperhdl.dk/)
