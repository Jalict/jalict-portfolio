For Ludum Dare 40 I made a game about flying and landing planes.

There are 5 airplanes in the game that needs to land before they run out of fuel.

You have to land the planes on the runways, if they don't land right they explode!

There are islands, each with their own runway.

You can switch between which airplane you are currently controlling using Q and E (Back and forth).
Airplanes are turned using A and D.
You land using Space.
