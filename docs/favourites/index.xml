      <description>From August to November in 2018 I had the pleasure of doing an Internship at Invisible Walls, where I got to work on First Class Trouble.
I worked as Gameplay Programmer in Unreal Engine and got to implement core systems, mechanics and user interfaces. All the features were also developed for online multiplayer by me.
Most of my work involved:
 Zone-based Oxygen System Multi-purpose Door System Collectable Passenger Logs Implementation of new User Interface  All my work was done i close collaboration with the team, I had a lot of freedom to come up with my own ideas and prototype them for the team.</description>
