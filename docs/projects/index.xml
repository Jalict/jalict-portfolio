      <description>For my thesis on MSc. Games Technology I worked together with Sven Santema on implementing a spline-based interface for skin weight editing inside the Unity Engine.
The goal of the project was to implement and test a state-of-the-art method developed by Bang and Lee[1] to identify user experience and usability within the implementation inside Unity. A prototype was implemented which works for real-time editing where users can create skinning from the ground up.</description>

      <description>For Global Game Jam 2019 I worked on a fishing-ish game. Your objective is to capture fish and to retrive them to your home island.
I worked mainly on some fishing triggers, effects and sound implementations.
The general idea was that we wanted to explore some of the new Shader Graphs and Visual Effect tools.
Game was made together with Andy Touch, Sven Santema, Rare≈ü Popa and Nikolaj Licht. The game can also be found on Global Game Jam</description>

      <description>Car Herder is a Local Multiplayer game about herding a flock of cars towards you. The game was inspired and is a analogy of herding sheeps. But instead we tried make some other kind of objects more animated, in which we choosed police cars herding civilian cars on a parking lot.
Initially we liked the idea of chasing a flock of boids. We implemented this fairly quickly and got a prototype up and running.</description>

      <description>For my third device in the shitty device series I have made a Adjective Randomizer. When the device is started the user is presented with a &amp;ldquo;Press button to search&amp;rdquo; on the display. When the user holds down the button it will then start &amp;ldquo;searching&amp;rdquo;, as you let go of the button a random adjective will be presented on the display. You can then proceed to do this to get more random adjectives.</description>

      <description>BIRTH. REPRODUCTION. DEATH. MUTATION
HEXIL is game about reproduction your hexagon. The game is heavily inspired by Conyway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life, but with added depth in form of solid and non-solid hexagons and mutations. Mutations will kill more and filled hexagons gives your a higher score.
The game is made without a direct clear goal and exist more as an exploratory puzzle, but a score can give a sense of progression.</description>

      <description>Rovers from Russia and China are on a mission to getting Science signals from Earth.
The Game is a Team-based Local Multiplayer, where the goal is to receive a pattern of 4 notes (Left and Right Motor) through Haptic Feedback in your controller in which you have to communicate to your partner who has to use Left and Right Shoulder to mimic the pattern. As you succeed to establish a connection and slowly earn points until you win, when you are linked you have to avoid crossing your link with an opponent or asteroids.</description>

      <description>First Semester of Msc. Games Technology in Game Programming we were given final assignement to make a game using the Simple Render Engine (SRE). Our group deciced to create a basic Minecraft-clone, with the main interesting of working on a proper voxel data structure together with chunk manangement.
The final result is a simple game with the same mechanics as Minecraft: You can mine blocks and place them. We added some extra small functions like flying and added a few details for particle systems together with textures but the big thing is that we achived a stable 60FPS gameplay with 262,144 voxels loaded.</description>

      <description>For Ludum Dare 40 I made a game about flying and landing planes.
There are 5 airplanes in the game that needs to land before they run out of fuel.
You have to land the planes on the runways, if they don&amp;rsquo;t land right they explode!
There are islands, each with their own runway.
You can switch between which airplane you are currently controlling using Q and E (Back and forth).</description>

      <description>For my fourth device in the shitty device series I have made a Dialer. Using the keypad the user &amp;ldquo;call&amp;rdquo; any number which will output the common DTMF tones. You can choose to record a specific set of numbers and then play them back, creating a sort of a sequencer also.
It uses an Arduino Nano, 3x4 keypad, 9V battery, two piezo speakers for tones, and a toggle switch to turn it on and off.</description>

      <description>Ice hopping is a vertical jumping game in which a single player controls a penguin and attempts to navigate across a sea of icebergs without falling off and becoming submerged in freezing water. Inspired by the game &amp;ldquo;Island Hopping&amp;rdquo;, the penguin constantly moves forward at a constant velocity, with the player limited to controlling the penguin by turning left or right and by jumping (as well as double jumping). All movement is controlled via the mouse.</description>

      <description>For the Game Prototyping course at ITU Games Technology we were given the task to Modify an already existing game.
Our game took the classical Arkanoid game and added an extra player to the game, becoming Two Player Blockbreaker. We tried different iteration and prototyped with features such as two balls, one for each player. And ended with just a single ball where the player gains point depending on who were the last to hit there ball.</description>

      <description>POSTBUD is about bringing the mail to your friendly neighbourhood.
The world is ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù as in you can proceed to the end of the world and come out of the start.
I had the idea that you had specific mail to specific places in the world. And it was your job to find these places in time before they got angry.
Due to me getting into an accident to only worked on it for like 7 hours and then about 2-3 hours with only one hand.</description>

      <description>As part of a gift series I have started for my friends, I came up with a Bit Tunes generator for my second device.
The device is using an Arduino, two potentiometers for input and a piezo speaker for output. The user can turn on the device, in which is starts playing random notes, you can then modulate them using the dials creating new sounds. I wanted to emulate something old and recognisable for the sound, so it is like old bit tunes.</description>

      <description>My bachelor project at Aalborg University was an investigation of character behaviour and engangement. We looking into the how players were affected when NPC&amp;rsquo;s have behaviour change in their own emergence. We implemented a whole visual communication system and created a smaller community using Utillity based AI. The NPC&amp;rsquo;s had jobs and different needs and desires and in the test scenario the player could not just interrupt if the NPC were doing something specific at the time.</description>

      <description>For my 3rd semester at my bachelor I worked on a Tool made in Unity which could interpret hand-drawn paper topography. Using a USB HD Webcam we were able to crop, cut and do image processing in real-time which were translated into a terrain in Unity. After the terrain stage you were able to draw symbols in order to create Towns and Forests in the world.
The motivation was to have easier methods for creating game worlds for artists with much faster prototyping methods which could be further development using ordinary unity tools.</description>
